					<h3>SudoKuest</h3>
					<h4>C# | XNA 3.1 | University individual project | 2008</h4>			
					<p>This project was completed as my University final year project and was designed to run on both the PC and Xbox360 through the XNA architecture.</p>
					<p>RPG Campaign - Players start by choosing a name and distributing attribute points to their character. They then proceed around a network map of destinations to further the story, complete quests, buy/sell items and fight AI enemies. Enemies are placed in between destinations and bumping into them will trigger a fight.</p>
					<p>Fighting is based on a competitive game of Sudoku on a single grid. Each number a player correctly fills in results in their opponent taking damage. An incorrect placement renders the player unable to move. At certain levels, they also learn spells that can cause damage, heal or freeze their opponent. The number of damage, HP, MP and regenerative abilities is based on their attributes and buffing items they have. Other items can be used to heal HP or MP.</p>
					<p>Puzzle mode - This is where players can play a normal game of Sudoku with a wide range of difficulty settings. The Sudoku grid is then randomly generated. Difficulty is based on the complexity of the techniques used to solve the puzzle and how many possible placements there are in each step. There is a wide range of options for the player whilst solving the puzzle:</p>
					<ul><li>'Pencil' allows them to enter in possible candidate number for a cell</li>
					<li>Show/hide all the possible candidates for all the cells</li>
					<li>Show/hide the errors they have entered</li>
					<li>Provide a hint</li>
					<li>Solve the puzzle</li>
					<li>Zoom in or out</li></ul>
					<p>Multiplayer modes - They can play in a competitive Sudoku fight either in local multiplayer or over the network. For network multiplayer, a player must set up as a host and another can select to join that session. It also supports VoIP and is fully integrated into the Windows Live and Xbox Live systems. It also supports cross-platform network multiplayer.</p>
					<p>The project incorporates some important features:</p>
					<ul><li>A very efficient random generation of solvable Sudoku grids</li>
					<li>Human techniques to solve and rate how hard a Sudoku grid is</li>
					<li>A fully featured story and puzzle mode</li>
					<li>Local multiplayer</li>
					<li>Fully integrated Microsoft Live cross-platform network multiplayer</li>
					<li>Xbox360 and Windows compatibility with both game controller and keyboard input</li>
					<li>Beautiful graphics and art</li>
					<li>Full music and sound effects</li></ul>
					<p>* All art and design was done by me except for the character art (Joe Madureira) and item and spell icons (Blizzard from Warcraft III). Sound effects was taken from Soundsnap.com and music is from the The Last of the Mohicans OST, Shadow of the Colossus OST and artist Daduk.</p>

					<h3>Dice Wars</h3>
					<h4>C++ | OpenGL | Personal Project | 2008</h4>			
					<p>Based on the original turn-based strategy Flash game Dice Wars. </p>
					<p>It is a simplified version of the board game Risk, where the goal is to control every territory of the map. The map is divided into 25-32 territories, which is randomly divided between 8 players at the start of the game. A random number of dice (representing forces) is evenly distributed to each territory. Each player then decides whether to gain more territory by attacking neighbours or hold to replenish forces.</p>
					<p>When a player decides to attack another territory, the dice they have on the attacking territory is rolled and the total is accumulated. The same occurs for the defending territory and if the attacker has a greater total then the defender, then they invade that territory. The number of dice between the territories is then split, with one die remaining on the original attacking territory and the remaining dice on the new territory. If the attack is not successful, then the number of dice on the attacking territory is reduced to one. Dice is replenished at the end of a turn and the number is determined by the player's largest collection of adjacent territories, and is distributed randomly.</p>
					<p>Unique to my implementation of Dice Wars is a fully built random map generator and varying levels of AI. A player/computer selection screen has not yet been implemented but to show the different range of AI, the players are divided as follows: Purple (Human player), Red, Pink and Blue (Easy AI), Green and Yellow (Medium AI), Orange and Teal (Hard AI).</p>
					<p>For this project I used a custom API developed by a colleague, based on imitating the functionality of the iPhone handset. It uses a modified version of OpenGL to handle the graphics.</p>
					<p>Features:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Detailed random map generator</li>
						<li>An intelligent AI with a range of difficulties</li>
						<li>Colourful and detailed graphics</li>
						<li>Touch screen input controls</li>
						<li>Press 'Q' to generate a new map</li>

						<img data-caption="The strong AI and random map generation often results in interesting and varying scenarios occurring. Early on in this game, Yellow (Medium AI) has taken the initiative but is quite stretched. Where as Red, Pink and Blue (Easy AI) are fairly scattered across the map. Teal and Orange (Hard AI) on the other hand have worked up a smaller but more concentrated area." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ftsOyCpKsfs/Vf5TncjVQiI/AAAAAAAALY0/PHc1SC6gJ3M/s640/dws1.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="As the map progresses, Yellow (M) is gone because they stretched them self out too far and was easily attacked. Red's (E) novice gung-ho approach has actually paid off and they have managed to build a small contingent. Although it seems that Teal and Orange's (H) more thoughtful and reserved nature has allowed them to build up a bigger force." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PftZ1OPlyc0/Vf5TnenTMEI/AAAAAAAALY8/t3LRq7aCm9A/s640/dws2.jpg" />

					<h3>The Diplominator AI</h3>
					<h4>Java | University group project | 2008</h4>			
					<p>Diplomacy is a strategic board game where players compete to dominate a map, with a strong emphasis on negotiation. The Diplominator bot was designed to be a negotiating agent to succeed in a game by forming allies to make the best strategic moves possible.</p>
					<p>This was a group university project where I was one member in a team of five. My main responsibilities were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial design and implementation for base strategy (not yet involving any negotiation)</li>
						<li>Designing how the bot uses negotiating information to adjust it's priorities.</li>
						<li>Forming information from it's decisions to send to the server.</li>
						<li>The bot performed well in press 0 (no negotations) and press 10 (simple negotations) games.</li>
					</ul>

						<img data-caption="This is a 10 press (forms allies) game of Diplomacy. The Diplominator bot will be playing England (Red), Russia (Purple) and Italy (Green). Everyone else will be played by DumbBot." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-guwzbTDmL2E/Vf5dTdj8yII/AAAAAAAALbc/fzD3GO6bMRM/s640/Image0.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="Here England and Italy have captured an extra base, whilst France is seems to be have the best start, having captured three extra bases." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vgbfJYJuh-M/Vf5dTeCh7dI/AAAAAAAALcU/Xx4qtkUf-JY/s640/Image1.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="Unfortunately, we cannot see the alliances that have been set up, but it seems reasonable to suggest that England and Russia have formed a relationship as they have not attacked each other. Italy on the other hand seems to be in a position where they are too far out to form a partnership." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KwewYH4qdQ4/Vf5dUESkjMI/AAAAAAAALbs/f3fVwWWgqhQ/s640/Image2.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="The three main forces that have appeared are England, Germany and Turkey. England is having trouble breaking through to the main land but are doing well to hold onto the Channel. Russia's situation has not improved since the start and Italy are in a bad shape." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5jFD3PlGq7k/Vf5dUXhx7aI/AAAAAAAALcQ/Fu9YrNsAJ2I/s640/Image3.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="England have managed to flank the enemy and steal a base, whilst still managing to hold their ground and break into the mainland. Both Russia and Italy have nearly lost and Turkey's large empire are now the main threat in the long run. Germany are very spread out but France seem to have held their ground well against England." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OvHctJe6f04/Vf5dUtYYqUI/AAAAAAAALcM/cuCtOrXeAeg/s640/Image4.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="England have made a lot of progress capturing many shore lines with their boats but with no armies on the main land. The alliance with Russia is even more evident now as they have not yet invaded that territory despite there being few defences. Although, Russia and Italy are barely surviving." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Goc01IBxxjk/Vf5dU7sFiRI/AAAAAAAALb8/l_wF9_R20MM/s640/Image5.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="England's earlier flank paid out as they still managed to hold that area and now have reinforcements. They now have taken a large part of the shore line and France is theirs for the taking. Their armies can be seen preparing to cross over. Italy have surprisingly managed to capture a base. Turkey still seem to be the largest threat." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pt5VVOwGlNI/Vf5dVGVE32I/AAAAAAAALcc/6K85f2Fyo-k/s640/Image6.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="In a surprising twist, England have given the final blow to Russia. They have expanded in the South and are now battling hard against the Turkish. They are still having a lot of trouble sending their troops to the main land against the small French resistance." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pHMrdWNsEDU/Vf5dVZSbiNI/AAAAAAAALcI/VCz_QzNYI54/s640/Image7.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="Despite fighting on many fronts, England has managed to hold their ground and are only a few bases away from winning." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iXTRAkp-94M/Vf5dVv0ih7I/AAAAAAAALcg/HRL8DwkRhH0/s640/Image8.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="England have seem to have given up on gaining the inland bases and have focused on a strictly boats only affair, in hope of taking the remaining bases they need from Turkey." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vsfm58XUgUU/Vf5dWBk8KXI/AAAAAAAALck/XtKF68W9f3o/s640/Image9.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="Turkey have managed to hold out, and also managed to deploy an army. If they can manage to capture many of the unguarded inland bases, they may still stand a chance." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PerdlPoDucE/Vf5dTSQXvBI/AAAAAAAALcY/SYkH768MH2w/s640/Image10.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="Italy seem to be still fighting and have come from having only one base to now being third on the map with four bases. Although a fight back from Turkey seems less then likely now, and looks like only a matter of grabbing the last few bases for England to get the win." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6gHZwxJ89N8/Vf5dTyqLDKI/AAAAAAAALb0/bMnxLEtDaEs/s640/Image11.jpg" />
						<img data-caption="There it is! England manage to grab the last base needed in what was once Italy. The Diplominator wins!" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1BZF4jVUJfs/Vf5dUJ3O8_I/AAAAAAAALbo/EqNdglud-IA/s640/Image12.jpg" />
