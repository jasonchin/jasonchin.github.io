					<div class="service-entry">
						<p>
							An experienced and dedicated <span>Gameplay Programmer</span> with a passion for creating exciting and immersive gaming experiences. 
						</p>

						<!-- Experience at PlayStation London Studio -->
						<p>
							Over the past six years, I dedicated my expertise to <span>PlayStation London Studio</span>, where I rose to the role of Lead Gameplay Programmer for a first-party multiplayer action title. In this capacity, I spearheaded the advancement of our combat and player-facing systems. I was also a key feature owner, leading a multidisciplinary team. Throughout my tenure at PlayStation, I played a pivotal role in shaping not only key technical aspects but also the creative direction of our projects.
						</p>

						<!-- Other experience -->
						<p>
							Prior to that, I have also worked for the game studio <span>JContents</span> in Osaka, developing games for some of Japan's biggest companies. Previously, I have also worked at <span>Memrise</span>, the pioneering language learning platform, <span>Mindshapes</span>, an award winning educational company for children and <span>Marmalade Game Studio</span>, developing hit mobile games such as Call of Duty: Blackops Zombies, Backbreaker Football: Tackle Alley and Fable Coin Golf.
						</p>

						<!-- Education -->
						<!-- </p>
							Prior to working in the games industry, I completed my education at <b>Imperial College London</b> and during my time there I graduated with a Bachelor's of Engineering Degree for Computing with a 2:1 Hons.
						</p> -->

						<!-- Longer description -->
						<p>
							Throughout my career, I've consistently bridged the divide between technology and design. While my dedication lies in the core aspects of programming — <span>solid system design, effective problem-solving, and clean, efficient code</span> — I also possess a deep understanding of <span>game mechanics and design principles</span>. I take pleasure in analytically dissecting games, examining their thematic and artistic elements, and gaining insight into their inner workings.
						</p>

						<!-- Goal -->
						<p>
							My goal is to leverage my talents to become a key creative figure in creating games that <span>push the boundaries</span> of interative entertaiment.
						</p>

								<h3>First Playable</h3>
								<p>The First Playable build was a showcase of many of the <span>core combat systems</span> that we wanted to build out for this title. It contained many traditional mechanics and structures that you'd might find of this kind of game but also included some key unique features too.</p>
								<p>As a Lead, I constantly drove the team to maintain a <span>rapid prototyping mentality</span> and workflows to quickly iterate on the title, making sure they stayed focused on the goals of the project and quickly making decisions to pivot when it was needed. The results of which kept the team <span>highly enganged and highly productive</span>. This consistently  produced highly positive in our playtests. </p>
								<p>I also played a <span>key creative role</span> in many core aspects of the design. Working intimately with the Lead Designers, I would provide <span>critical feedback</span> and make pivotal suggestions for improvement. I would often make <span>proposals for new systems or gameplay improvements</span> that would end up as key components to the core design.</p>
								<p>My other main responsibility was to implement many of the features that went into the build, with a particular focus on striking a balance between creating a <span>strong maintainable structure and allowing for rapid turnarounds</span>. </p>

								<h3>Combat Systems</h3>

								<p>I defined and built how many of the <span>melee combat</span> systems works, including:</p>

								<li>Animation cancelling</li>

								<h3>Ability System</h3>
								<p>A core system underpining the majority of our prototype work was the Abilty System (similar to Unreal Engine's GAS). Many of the behaviours that were implemented were defined as abilities in a <span>scalable and modular</span> way. Along with defining attributes for a character and being able to alter those attributes dynamically, we created a <span>systematic way</span> to how we could define our gameplay. </p>
								<p>I was instrumental in mapping out these systems and pushing for them to be built so that we can <span>rapidly develop the core gameplay</span>.</p>

								<h3>Enemy AI</h3>
								<p>I also had built up many of the structures defining how our AI was created. This included setting out how we used our AI Controller, Behaviour Trees and Spacial Queries in such a way that would allow it to be <span>scalable and efficient</span>. Along with our Ability System, it mean that it was very rapid in <span>introducing new enemy archetypes</span> as many of the core functionality was already set up to be shared amongst themselves. </p>
								<p>For a few of the key enemy archetypes, I was also the main stakeholder in <span>designing and implementing them</span>. This included: </p>
								<ul><li>Outlining their core behaviour.</li>
								<li>Their <span>purpose for existing in relation to the player</span>.</li>
								<li>How they complement other existing enemies.</li>
								<li>Their token and aggro systems.</li></ul> 
								<p>I had a particular focus on following the principle that they had to have <span>clear, simple and easy to read behaviour</span> so that the player can understand what is required of them to tackle those enemies. </p>

								<h3>First Playable</h3>
								<p>The First Playable build was a showcase of many of the <span>core combat systems</span> that we wanted to build out for this title. It contained many traditional mechanics and structures that you'd might find of this kind of game but also included some key unique features too.</p>
								<p>As a Lead, I constantly drove the team to maintain a <span>rapid prototyping mentality</span> and workflows to quickly iterate on the title, making sure they stayed focused on the goals of the project and quickly making decisions to pivot when it was needed. The results of which kept the team <span>highly enganged and highly productive</span>. This consistently  produced highly positive in our playtests. </p>
								<p>I also played a <span>key creative role</span> in many core aspects of the design. Working intimately with the Lead Designers, I would provide <span>critical feedback</span> and make pivotal suggestions for improvement. I would often make <span>proposals for new systems or gameplay improvements</span> that would end up as key components to the core design.</p>
								<p>My other main responsibility was to implement many of the features that went into the build, with a particular focus on striking a balance between creating a <span>strong maintainable structure and allowing for rapid turnarounds</span>. </p>

								<p>In particular I had a big role in defining many of the combat systems required in both the <span>technical and creative aspects</span>.  </p>
								<p>I defined and built how many of the <span>melee combat</span> systems works, including:</p>

								<li>Hitstop implementations</li>
								<li>Animation cancelling</li>

								<p>This title was an unannounced first-party multiplayer PvE live service action game for <span>PlayStation 5 and PC</span>. I was involved with this project from its inception, working from the pitching phase, building up the intial prototypes, iteration on it's design and implementing it into a production environment.</p>
								<p>As Lead Gameplay Programmer, I was intimitately involved with many aspects of the game such as the <span>core melee and ranged combat systems, enemy AI, camera, controls and traversal mechanics.</span></p>
								<p>As we progressed into production, I was entrusted to lead a multidisciplinary team as one of the <span>key feature owners.</span></p>
								<p>The engine we used for production was an in-house engine that utilised <span>determinism, rollback and ECS.</span></p>
